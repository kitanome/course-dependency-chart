These applications require a broad range of conceptual understanding ranging from user interface design and client/server-side concepts and programming to caching, monitoring, scalability, and performance issues. These techniques need to work collectively to bring the end user a single working system. Unlike traditional waterfall methods of software development that demand a focus on design before development, agile development emphasizes techniques that require an iterative design, development, and deploy process. Test driven development is the focus and a working system is always available for review. This 1 credit course will require students to be managers that lead a software development team (students enrolled in 497S) to the successful completion and deployment of a real web application. Students enrolled in this course will be required to hold team meetings, manage work and design, and evaluate the individual work and contributions of students taking 497S and meet with the instructor to read and discuss agile software development and techniques from the literature.

In reality, web applications are extremely difficult to get right. They involve a large collection of coordinated services, multiple databases, complicated user interfaces, security and performance issues, and ever changing 3rd party services, spread across physical and virtual machines. These complications are further stressed by the large number of concurrent users that access these applications every second. This course will investigate several well known web-based applications and the technology and software architecture used to scale these applications.

Another goal is to understand how current researchers in the field of educational data mining, AI in Education, and educational technology are using a variety of techniques to understand and model their data. We will cover many different methods, from machine learning methods applied to educational data and classic models inspired by cognitive theory. We will also cover various applications including computerized adaptive testing, affect detection, reading and writing analysis, activity log analysis, and instructional policy design.

The course is appropriate for students from many disciplines (e.g., computer science, linguistics, education, and psychology), researchers, and practitioners from academia, industry, and government. No programming is required. Students will read and critique papers about AI tools (e.g., vision, natural language), methods, and will study the complexity of human learning through advances in cognitive science. Weekly assignments invite students to critique the literature and a final project requires a detailed specification (not a program) for a tutor on your chosen topic. Students present readings from the research literature and several working systems will be available for hands-on or virtual critique.",

        "description": "Many cognitive abilities once solely the province of biological systems are now routinely achievable with machines. Once no more than a dream, abilities such as complex 3D perception, natural language, machine translation, speech recognition, learning, and reasoning are now routinely achievable even on low cost hardware, such as cellphones, tablets, or similar devices, which can access larger scale servers for offline computation. This seminar explores the next frontiers for AI, presuming that many human cognitive abilities will be largely achieved in the next decade (vision, language, learning, reasoning, speech recognition), with the massive computing and data resources likely to be available to individuals and to corporations like Google, Baidu, Facebook, and IBM. To put it another way, core cognitive abilities are no longer \"mysteries.\" but matters of mundane albeit challenging engineering.  What's left for AI? Will \"artificial intelligence\" be achieved when machines achieve human level performance in these core cognitive abilities, or, as one philosopher put it in the early heady days of AI, have we merely climbed a tall tree on the way to getting to the moon? Our thesis is that the really interesting aspects of AI are only now beginning to be possible, given that the \"operating system\" level functionalities listed above are achievable. This seminar will discuss how AI research in the next decade or two can begin to tackle each of these problems.  1. Emotion: current AI systems can learn effectively from reinforcement, but feel no emotion. Is emotion necessary to build truly intelligent cyborgs? We explore the current theories of emotion, and its connections to rational decision making.  2. Consciousness: AI systems can carry out inference and reason about choices, but are not conscious of their own self, in the sense that most mammals are. What's missing? We review the current theories of consciousness.  3. Curiosity: AI systems can be programmed to carry out tasks using high level rewards and goals, but seem incapable of setting themselves their own tasks and goals. How can we build AI systems that are curious in the sense that children are. What are the essential elements of curiosity?  4. Mortality: AI systems have no fear of ?death? and do not concern themselves with their \"mortality,\" in the sense that humans (and presumably other mammals) do. However, as AI systems learn from experience and compile massive knowledge bases, they may face similar challenges in being \"unplugged,\" faced with the loss of everything they know and have learned. (HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey certainly feared its own death). Why is mortality important to incorporate in future AI systems?",
