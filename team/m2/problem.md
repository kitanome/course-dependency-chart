# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

Course prerequisites on SPIRE can sometimes be unclear and makes planning harder for many people. On top of that, navigating through classes on SPIRE individually can be slow and frustrating. Many websites were created to help alleviate some of the issues with SPIRE navigation but course descriptions can be outdated or sometimes not clear at all.

## Proposed Solution

Our web application, "Course Dependency Chart", provides a more accurate and interactive solution for course planning. This application helps you understand the course descriptions better, its dependencies with other courses and helps you decide
which courses to take further ahead with our tree / graph design

The features of this website includes:

- **Detailed course description**: Aside from information you would usually see on SPIRE, courses will now tell you what you need to take before and alongside this course, as well what courses this serves as prerequisites for. If the course is offered seasonally, it would be displayed as such in the description as well

- **Professor information**: Shows you which professors are currently teaching the course to aid you in lecture sections decision.

- **Visual roadmap of courses**: Provides you an overview of all the courses in the chosen Major through an intuitive, interactive graphical roadmap.

## Why this matters

Making decisions on what you want to study can be confusing for many students, especially those who are uncertain about what they want to pursue, or don't have a clear understanding of what the major offers them in undergraduate years. Some students are also hesitant to talk to advisors, professors or friends on the course roadmap due to personal issues as well. Course Dependency Chart helps as the middleman to counter these issues students may encounter. It gives you the most general idea of which course exists under your major curriculum, requires students to complete before moving on, and clears out all confusion with course descriptions when course admission time comes around. All of these solutions provided in a more fast and reactive web application helps course planning a much more time efficient process for students to plan out their study at UMass.
