Instructor(s): Phuthipong Bovornkeeratiroj, Meng-Chieh Chiu
Large-scale software systems like Google - deployed over a world-wide network of hundreds of thousands of computers - have become a part of our lives. These are systems success stories - they are reliable, available ("up" nearly all the time), handle an unbelievable amount of load from users around the world, yet provide virtually instantaneous results. On the other hand, many computer systems don't perform nearly as well as Google - hence the now-clich "the system is down." In this class, we study the scientific principles behind the construction of high-performance, scalable systems. The course begins with a discussion of C data representation, and moves up the stack from there to the features of modern architectures, assembly languages, and operating system services such as I/O, process, and synchronization.

In conjunction, these sensors can enable higher-order inferences about more complex human activities/behavioral states (e.g., activity patterns, stress, sleep, social interactions, etc.). Such ubiquitous sensing in daily life, referred to as mobile health sensing, promises to revolutionize our understanding of human activities and health conditions. This course is a hands-on introduction to personal health sensing through mobile phones. Please note that this is a *programming-heavy* class so a solid programming background is required.

The course objective is to provide students with a strong understanding of attack patterns, and to ensure students implement more secure coding practices in their own code. This course begins with an introduction to Intel-based assembly, reverse engineering, vulnerability analysis, and various forms of Linux-focused binary exploitation. The course then covers stack, heap and Linux kernel-based exploitation, and dive into common defensive mitigations such as ASLR, NX and Stack Cookies alongside techniques to bypass each of them. This course is focused on low-level software written in C. COMPSCI 230 is sufficient for demonstrating knowledge of C and that the student has been introduced to assembly. Students who have taken 198C (or can demonstrate a proficiency in C) and can demonstrate a familiarity with assembly can request an override from the instructor.

In this course we examine the important problems in operating system design and implementation. The operating system provides a well-known, convenient, and efficient interface between user programs and the bare hardware of the computer on which they run. The operating system is responsible for allowing resources (e.g., disks, networks, and processors) to be shared, providing common services needed by many different programs (e.g., file service, the ability to start or stop processes, and access to the printer), and protecting individual programs from one another. The course will start with a brief historical perspective of the evolution of operating systems over the last fifty years, and then cover the major components of most operating systems. This discussion will cover the tradeoffs that can be made between performance and functionality during the design and implementation of an operating system. Particular emphasis will be given to three major OS subsystems: process management (processes, threads, CPU scheduling, synchronization, and deadlock), memory management (segmentation, paging, swapping), file systems, and operating system support for distributed systems.

COMPSCI 426: Scalable Web Systems
Instructor(s): Timothy Richards
The web has become a large and complex area for application development. Access to an abundance of open source languages, libraries, and frameworks has led to the quick and easy construction of a variety of applications with several moving parts working in coordination to present to the user the illusion of a single program. In reality, web applications are extremely difficult to get right. They involve a large collection of coordinated services, multiple databases, complicated user interfaces, security and performance issues, and ever changing 3rd party services, spread across physical and virtual machines. These complications are further stressed by the large number of concurrent users that access these applications every second. This course will investigate several well known web-based applications and the technology and software architecture used to scale these applications. We will also study a specific topic related to scalability in software design in the context of web application architecture. This course counts as an Elective for the CS and INFORM Majors.

COMPSCI 627: Fixing Social Media
Instructor(s): Ethan Zuckerman
Over the past decade, user-generated participatory media social media has emerged as the dominant model for content of the Internet. From Facebook to Twitter, YouTube to Wikipedia, content created by non-professionals and circulated for commercial and non-commercial motives underpins seven of the top 10 websites in the US, and has become an increasingly important component of the news ecosystem. While social media was initially hailed as a powerful tool for broadening civic participation, many problems have emerged with the rise of the medium, from questions of whether social media usage is bad for our individual mental health, to whether the fabric of our democracy is being damaged by disinformation, fragmentation and hyperpolarization. As legislators look to regulate these platforms and commentators propose shutting them down entirely, this course looks for an alternative: affirmative visions of social media that are good for individuals and society, which we could work towards building. This class examines possible problems with existing modes of social media, discusses ways in which social media could be a benefit to individuals and societies, develops case studies of successful and healthy online communities, and ultimately designs and builds tools to improve existing social media systems or replace them with novel models. Students will write reflectively about weekly readings and discussions and participate in multi-week projects, ultimately building teams to work on final projects.
