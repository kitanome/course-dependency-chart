# Target Users

## Primary Audience

The primary users of our web app will be current UMass Amherst students that are planning their future courses. All students are required to sign up for classes using Spire, and the process can be confusing. Not every Umass student is an adept computer user, and may struggle to navigate the many menus on Spire.

## User Needs

UMass students need to be able to plan multiple semesters in advance. College isn't over in a semester, and requires lots of planning. Deciding which courses one wants to take in advance can help users make the right choices for them.

Students also need an easy-to-use app. Users need an easy and intuitive way to see their course prerequisites.

## Why These Users Matter

These users are the main focus of our application and are therefore critical to the success of the project. Our application is built with UMass courses in mind, and therefore needs to apply to UMass students. Students that use our application will be able to make better informed decisions about which courses to take. This could lead to drastically different paths through their majors, and even different jobs. Since college is such an important time in our lives, it makes sense that decisions about courses should be scrutinized and well thought out.
